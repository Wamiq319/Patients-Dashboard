# Patient Dashboard

## Overview
A responsive React-based patient dashboard developed from a client-provided XD design and API endpoint. The task was to convert the design into a responsive UI using React and Tailwind CSS, while dynamically populating patient details from an API.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Data Population**: Fetches and displays patient data using API calls for a single patient detail.
- **Industry Standards**: Built with best practices in mind, adhering to modern web development standards.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Axios**: For making API calls to populate patient data.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the overall structure and styling of the dashboard.
